# Soundfield

*Soundfield* is a [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks)-based application where:

- players indicate their positions on a map;
- a soloist can visualize the players' positions and play sounds on the players' smartphones via a touch interface.

Have a look at the *Soundworks* documentation [here](http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/)!
