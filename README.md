# Soundfield

Soundfield ([soundworks-soundfield](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-soundfield)) allows a soloist to play sound (and light) on the smartphones of other players.
At the beginning of the performance, the players indicate their positions on a map: their positions appear on the soloist's screen.
Then, the soloist can move his / her finger on screen: the players under the finger emit sound and light in real time.

Soundfield is a [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks)-based application (have a look at the *Soundworks* documentation [here](http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/)!).
