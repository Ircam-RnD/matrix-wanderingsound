# Wandering Sound

*Wandering Sound* is a collaborative performance based on [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks).

## Description

A representation of the spatial topology of the participants ---~usually a matrix~--- appears on the screen of a `player` who becomes a `soloist`. 
By moving a finger on the matrix on the screen, a soloist controls which smartphones emit light and sound.

The `soloist` can choose between a set of sounds generated with the Web Audio API, which are modulated by the speed of the finger on the screen.
This way, the `soloist` remotely plays on the other `player`s' smartphones and makes the light and sound wander across the room.

After some time, another `player` becomes `soloist` and takes over the control of light and sound.
